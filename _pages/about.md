## Hello!
Iâ€™m Rajeev Jain, a software developer and researcher. My current title is Principal Specialist, Research Software Engineering at the Argonne National Laboratory in the suburbs of Chicago â€” [Argonne Profile Page](https://www.anl.gov/profile/rajeev-jain).

My journey at Argonne since August 2009 has taken me through the fascinating realms of high-performance computing, where Iâ€™ve worked on diverse projects, from cancer data science to nuclear reactor simulations. During this time, Iâ€™ve been fortunate to learn from great people who have shaped my path. Collaborating with exceptional peers has also enriched my professional experience and Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of mentoring motivated juniors, which is incredibly rewarding. See my [projects](/projects/).

## Education
I graduated with a **[Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Mechanical Engineering](https://mechanical.iitism.ac.in/)** from **[Indian School of Mines (now Indian Institute of Technology, Dhanbad)](https://www.iitism.ac.in/)** in 2006.

I worked as a project engineer with **[Wipro Technologies](https://www.wipro.com)**, India from 2006 to 2007 before moving to the U.S.A. for higher education. I obtained two masterâ€™s degrees in the U.S.: first, in **[Structural Engineering](https://ssebe.engineering.asu.edu/)** from **[Arizona State University (ASU)](https://www.asu.edu/)** in 2009, and second, in **[Computer Science](https://cs.uchicago.edu/mpcs/)** from the **[University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/)** in 2020.
