Welcome to my website! Just here for my CV? You can download that [here](/files/Jain_CV.pdf). Please check out ways to reach me as well as my various other homes on the web in the menu (either to the left or above, depending on your screen resolution) and click the links at the top of the page to check out some of my other experience and work!

## What do/did I do?

I'm a Principal Research Software Developer at the Argonne National Laboratory in the suburbs of Chicago!.
Please feel free to reach out if you are interested in working together, either collaboratively or as a mentor/mentee. 

I graduated with a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Mechanical Engineering from Indian School of Mines (now Indian Institute of Technology, IIT) Dhanbad in 2006.

I worked as a project engineer with Wipro Technologies, India from 2006 to 2007, before moving to the U.S.A for higher education. I obtained two masterâ€™s degrees in the U.S., first, in Structural Engineering from Arizona State University (2009) and second, in Computer Science from University of Chicago (2020). Over the years I have been working on a variety of fields from Urban, Nuclear, Climate, Astrophysics and even Cancer, I am interested in managing multi-disciplinary simulation/computation for applications-oriented problems. I enjoy interacting with the local junior high and high school students in STEM-related activities.

<!-- Previously, I did my PhD in Materials Science and Engineering in the [Photovoltaics Research Lab](http://pv.mit.edu) at MIT, where I performed first-principles simulations to understand defect physics in solar cell materials (in close collaboration with [Vladan Stevanovic](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=itfRzZAAAAAJ&hl=en) of the Colorado School of Mines and National Renewable Energy Lab) as well as high-throughput device-level simulations to use Bayesian inference along with experimental data to more quickly and accurately measure fundamental materials properties. Prior to that, I received my MPhil in Materials Science and Metallurgy from the University of Cambridge, supported by a Gates Cambridge Scholarship. -->

About this site
===============

This website is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub Pages. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!
