## Hello!
I’m Rajeev Jain, a software developer and researcher. My current title is Principal Specialist, Research Software Engineering at the Argonne National Laboratory in the suburbs of Chicago — [Argonne Profile Page](https://www.anl.gov/profile/rajeev-jain). ⚛️💻

Since 2009, I’ve built high‑performance, reliable research software across cancer data science, climate computation, multiphysics simulation, urban systems, and nuclear reactor modeling. I like clear goals, simple designs, and fast feedback: build, test, measure, improve. 🚀

I’ve been fortunate to learn from great people and collaborate across disciplines — and I’ve loved mentoring motivated students along the way. See my current [projects](/projects/). 🤝
