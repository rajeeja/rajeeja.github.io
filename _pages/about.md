I’m Rajeev Jain, currently Principal Specialist, Research Software Engineering at Argonne National Laboratory. Since 2009, I’ve worked across cancer data science, climate computation, multiphysics simulation, urban systems, and reactor modeling. I like turning complex problems into dependable software with simple designs and steady improvements.

For fun: I like to bike 🚴, play pickleball 🏓, and learn about crypto ₿.
