List of all the projects I have worked on, currently working on or have managed in the past.

## Projects

After 2016, I started working on the three Exascale Compute Projects [ECP](https://www.exascaleproject.org/) two of them were R&D100 award winners: [CANDLE](https://candle.cels.anl.gov/), and [FLASH-X](https://flash-x.org/). The other exascale project was seed-funding, it lasted for 2-years (2016-2018) [Urban ECP](https://www.anl.gov/exascale/multiscale-coupled-urban-systems). Prior to that my work at Argonne revolved around managing different facets for the  [NEAMS](https://www.anl.gov/article/using-supercomputers-to-explore-nuclear-energy) project under team -[SIGMA/MeshKit/RGG](https://sigma.mcs.anl.gov/).

### IMPROVE/CANDLE (Cancer Data Science)
- **Duration:** January 2017 - Present
- **Highlights:**
  - Collaborated on a scalable workflow suite for comparing deep learning models in cancer drug response prediction.
  - Spearheaded CANDLE/Supervisor, a pioneering machine learning framework for cancer research, recognized with the prestigious R&D 100 Award in 2023.
  - Presented groundbreaking research at the Supercomputing conference in 2021, focusing on RNA-seq classification using abstention classifiers.

### UXARRAY (Climate Computation/Modeling)
- **Duration:** June 2021 - Present
- **Highlights:**
  - Actively contributed to the design and project management of UXarray, a Python library for managing unstructured climate and weather data.
  - Showcased UXarray at the SciPy conference in 2023.

### FLASH-X (Multiphysics Simulation, Astrophysics)
- **Duration:** June 2016 - September 2023
- **Highlights:**
  - Led the implementation of cutting-edge asynchronous I/O (HDF5) and compression functionalities (SZ3/ZFP) for the FLASH-X multiphysics simulation software.
  - Acknowledged with the R&D 100 Award in 2022 for achieving over 20% performance improvement in I/O-bound simulations.

### Urban ECP (Coupled Urban Simulations)
- **Duration:** June 2016 - September 2018
- **Highlights:**
  - Developed coupling software as part of the Urban ECP, integrating building energy models with high-fidelity weather data for downtown Chicago.
  - Co-authored a widely recognized research paper resulting from extensive teamwork with 12 researchers across 3 institutions.

### NEAMS SIGMA/MeshKit/RGG (Nuclear Reactor Simulations)
- **Duration:** August 2009 - September 2018
- **Highlights:**
  - Led the development of RGG MeshKit, a C++ toolkit for reactor geometry mesh generation.
  - Advised Kitware Inc. during the commercialization of RGG through SBIR Phase I & II.
  - Streamlined nuclear reactor core design using RGG software, reducing model generation time from weeks to hours.
  - Developed the core functionality of MeshKit, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) mesh generation toolkit.


<!-- 
My work focuses on managing multi-disciplinary simulation/computation for applications-oriented problems. Currently I work on several DOE-funded projects, including [FLASH-X](https://flash-x.org/), a highly composable multi-physics software system that can be used to simulate physical phenomena in several scientific domains; [CANDLE](https://ecp-candle.github.io/Candle/)/[IMPROVE](https://jdacs4c-improve.github.io/docs/), which develops Exascale deep-learning-enabled precision medicine for cancer; and [UXARRAY/SEATS](https://github.com/UXARRAY/uxarray/), which provides the geoscience community with tools that enable standard data analysis techniques to operate directly on unstructured grid data.

Over the years at Argonne I have worked on several projects, two major completed projects:

- [NEAMS](https://neams.inl.gov/) PI for [MeshKit](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1224960), published several [papers](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285446364_Scalable_Mesh_Generation_for_HPC_Applications)
  
- [Multiscale Coupled Urban Systems](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19401493.2018.1534275) - led a team of spanning 6 DOE labs. Idea: retrofit and improve urban districts with new technologies, knowledge, and tools. -->
