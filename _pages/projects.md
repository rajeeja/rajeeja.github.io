After 2016, I started working on the three Exascale Compute Projects [ECP](https://www.exascaleproject.org/), two of which were R&D100 award winners: [CANDLE](https://candle.cels.anl.gov/), and [FLASH-X](https://flash-x.org/). The other exascale project was seed-funded, lasting for 2 years (2016-2018) [Urban ECP](https://www.anl.gov/exascale/multiscale-coupled-urban-systems). Prior to that, my work at Argonne revolved around managing different facets of the [NEAMS](https://www.anl.gov/article/using-supercomputers-to-explore-nuclear-energy) project under team [SIGMA/MeshKit/RGG](https://sigma.mcs.anl.gov/).

### IMPROVE/CANDLE (Cancer Data Science)
