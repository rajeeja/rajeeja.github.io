I should mention my journey to obtaining the EB1-A green card; it was like waiting for a perfectly brewed cup of coffee. Although it felt like an eternity, the sweet success was worth it. After enduring countless paperwork cycles and a test of patience, I finally received the EB1-A green card in March 2024. It felt like winning the bureaucratic lottery, and now I'm ready to celebrate!

Applied for EB2 in 2013

Priority Date (PD): September 2014

Applied for EB1-A in 2022 (should have applied earlier)

Priority Date: 2023, ported just the PD from EB2 to EB1-A

Approved and received card: March 2024
